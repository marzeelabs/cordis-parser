Oxidoreductases are a class of enzymes with a very high potential for preparative organic synthesis, which is why they are increasingly used also on industrial scale. The current state-of-the-art, however, utilises valuable high-energy cosubstrates (such as glucose and alcohols) to promote oxidoreductases. Thereby valuable (and edible) building blocks are wasted as sacrificial electron donors which will have significant ethical (food for chemistry), economic and environmental consequences once redox biocatalysis is applied at scale.
I envision utilizing water as sacrificial electron donor. Hence, a simple and abundant cosubstrate will be used instead of the valuable cosubstrates mentioned above. This will be a completely new approach in (bio)catalysis.
However, activating water for this purpose water is extremely difficult due to its kinetic and thermodynamic inertness. To solve this problem, I propose using visible light as external energy source and advanced chemical catalysts to facilitate water oxidation. The electrons liberated in this process will be made available (for the first time) to promote oxidoreductases-catalysed transformations.

BioAqua represents an entirely new paradigm in catalysis as I will bridge the gap between photocatalysis and biocatalysis enabling cleaner and more efficient reaction schemes.";1998020;1998020;ERC-2014-CoG;ERC-COG;"TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT";NL;;;

The arms race between pathogen and plant demands constant adjustment of crop germplasm to tackle emerging pathogen races with new virulence features. To date, most crop disease resistance has relied on specific resistance genes that are effective only against a subset of races. We cannot solely rely on classical resistance genes to keep ahead of the pathogens. There is an urgent need to develop approaches based on knowledge of the pathogenâ€™s Achilles heel: core plant processes that are required for pathogen colonization.
Our hypothesis is that disease resistance based on manipulation of host accessibility processes has a higher probability for durability, and is best identified using a broad host-range pathogen. I will employ the filamentous pathogen Phytophthora palmivora to mine plant alleles and unravel host processes providing microbial access in roots and leaves of monocot and dicot plants.
In Aim 1 I will utilize plant symbiosis mutants and allelic variation to elucidate general mechanisms of colonization by filamentous microbes. Importantly, allelic variation will be studied in economically relevant barley and wheat to allow immediate translation into breeding programs.
In Aim 2 I will perform a comparative study of microbial colonization in monocot and dicot roots and leaves. Transcriptional profiling of pathogen and plant will highlight common and contrasting principles and illustrate the impact of differential plant anatomies.

We will challenge our findings by testing beneficial fungi to assess commonalities and differences between mutualist and pathogen colonization. We will use genetics, cell biology and genomics to find suitable resistance alleles highly relevant to crop production and global food security. At the completion of the project, I expect to have a set of genes for resistance breeding.";1991054;1991054;ERC-2014-STG;ERC-STG;"THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE";UK;;;

Thus, it is fundamental to understand how these areas acquire and maintain their identity and functional organization. Challenging normal brain development and forcing the brain to the limits of plasticity, offers us the possibility to shed light on these issues. Accordingly, we shall use prenatal sensory deprivation as a model to understand the mechanisms underlying early neuroplasticity, events that could influence the natural organization of sensory cortical areas. Early sensory deprivation produces profound changes in the cortex, provoking the reorganization of both the deprived and the spared cortical territories. Classically, this adaptation is thought to require sensory experience from the intact sensory modalities. However, our recent data from embryonic deprived mice challenge this view, suggesting that a component independent of experience contributes to this reorganization and that the thalamus plays a pivotal role in these events. Hence, we now propose to adopt multidisciplinary and innovative approaches to characterize the structural, genetic and functional rearrangements in the thalamus following embryonic sensory deprivation, and to define the factors and mechanisms that drive cortical specificity. Experimental results from sensory deprived animals in which the thalamus and gene expression is manipulated in vivo, will be integrated to explain when and how neuroplastic cortical adaptations are triggered in the deprived brain. To further understand the rewiring capacity of thalamic neurons and their potential role in sensory restoration, we will adopt a high-risk, high-gain approach to reprogramme nuclei specific thalamic neurons. The novel information obtained will establish how sensory inputs and thalamocortical connections govern cortical activity and architecture, ultimately sculpting perceptual behaviour.";1966770,78;1966770,78;ERC-2014-CoG;ERC-COG;"AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS";ES;;;

The steam is used in existing industrial steam systems for production in various industry segments. The technology works as a fuel saver technology by reducing energy costs, dependency on oil and gas and CO2 emission of its customers.
Through a patented innovation Fresnex GmbH will be able to significantly reduce the system costs compared to existing technologies while parallel reducing the complexity of integration. Due to the lower investment costs, projects are now financial attractive, opening up a huge market. In Portugal, Spain, Italy and Austria together about 5,5 TWh could be switched to solar with even more potential in South Africa, Mexico, US, and many other countries.
The innovation itself relates to a new and cheap mirror bearing, pivotable holding the mirrors. It is realised through a line-hinge in a cheap, effective and precise way. The thermal performance of the system prototype has been proved by a solar testing institute with good results.
The management (two former university colleagues with 14 years of track record in plant engineering and construction) are the majority owners of Fresnex GmbH and they plan to sell company shares to further fund the project in addition to the already inserted private equity.
In order to better understand the market needs and to gain customer contacts, Fresnex will perform a customer survey and address technical and financial topics as H2020 phase one project.
The commercialisation plan includes a first system in industrial environment in 2015 (TRL5 to 6) followed by two reference systems for large scale implementations. At the same time the semi-automated production line will be developed. Without at least parts of this semi-automated production line, the two reference plants cannot be built (phase 2 project).";71429;50000;H2020-SMEINST-1-2015;SME-1;"FRESNEX GMBH";AT;;;
